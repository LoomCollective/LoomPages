## Introduction

The Ricker model<cite data-cite="Ricker, W.E. (1954). Stock and Recruitment. Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada 11(5):559–623."></cite> describes how a population changes from one generation to the next:

$$
N_{t+1} = N_t \cdot r \cdot e^{-N_t / K}
$$

where $N_t$ is the population at time $t$, $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate, and $K$ is the carrying capacity.

## Interactive model

The widget below lets you explore how $r$ changes the long-run dynamics. Try dragging the slider.

## Stability analysis

For small values of $r$, the population converges to a fixed point. As $r$ increases, period-doubling bifurcations appear — and eventually the dynamics become chaotic.

<span class="sidenote-anchor" data-sn="1">The period-doubling route to chaos</span> was described by Robert May in his landmark 1976 *Nature* paper, which showed that even simple ecological models produce unpredictable dynamics.

    <p>At $r = 2.692$, the Ricker model enters its first period-doubling bifurcation. The population alternates between two values rather than settling at a fixed point.</p>
