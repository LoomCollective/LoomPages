Loom is a Jekyll site built for technical writing that earns its complexity. Clean typography by default, with a progressive visualisation layer that loads only what a page needs.

## Design principles

Three ideas shaped every decision:

**No JavaScript tax on simple posts.** A post with only prose and code blocks loads no charting libraries, no mapping SDKs, no math renderers. The runtime detects what each page uses and loads accordingly.

**Dark mode that doesn't fight itself.** Syntax highlighting, maps, charts, and diagrams all respond to the theme toggle. No bright rectangles marooned in a dark page.

**Essays as a first-class format.** Long-form computational work needs a different layout than a blog post — sticky table of contents, margin sidenotes, reading progress, scrollytelling. Loom treats these as core, not bolt-ons.

## The stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Static site | Jekyll 4.3 | Mature, GitHub Pages native, no Node server |
| CSS | Tailwind 3 + custom tokens | Utility-first for layout, custom properties for theming |
| JS | Alpine.js + ES modules | Reactive UI without a framework build step |
| Build | Vite 6 | Fast bundling of `src/main.css` and `src/main.js` |
| Deploy | GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages | Zero server cost, automatic on push |

## How the visualisation runtime works

`assets/js/core.js` runs on every page. It checks which libraries the page needs, loads only those from CDN, and hands off to adapter modules:

```
core.js reads the REGISTRY
  ↓
detect() — does this page use math? diagrams? D3?
  ↓
loadCDN() — fetch only the needed scripts/styles
  ↓
render() — mount each [data-viz], [data-d3], [data-leaflet] element
  ↓
wireScrolly() — route story:step events to the matching adapter
```

Adding a new library means adding one entry to `viz-registry.js`. The rest of the machinery handles loading, mounting, and scrolly updates automatically.

## What this series covers

The next posts in this series walk through each part of the visualisation system with live examples:

- **Mathematics and diagrams** — KaTeX for inline and display math; Mermaid for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams
- **Interactive charts** — ECharts for production charts; D3 for custom data graphics with a built-in registry for extension
- **Scrollytelling** — Leaflet maps with flyTo transitions; D3 bar charts animating through data states driven by scroll position

Each post is also a test of the system it describes — if the chart renders, the pipeline works.
