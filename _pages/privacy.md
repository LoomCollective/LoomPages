This site is a static publication hosted on GitHub Pages. It does not run a database, does not require login, and does not collect personal data.

## What is stored

- **Dark mode preference** — stored in your browser's `localStorage` under the key `loom-dark`. Never transmitted anywhere.
- **GitHub Pages** — GitHub may log standard web server data (IP address, browser, pages visited) as part of hosting. See [GitHub's privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Third-party CDN assets

Some posts load libraries from CDN providers (jsDelivr, unpkg, Google Fonts). These providers may log requests per their own policies. No tracking pixels or advertising scripts are loaded.

## Analytics

This site currently has no analytics. If that changes, this page will be updated.
