Collections are thematic reading paths through the Loom archive — essays grouped by the structural ideas they share rather than by date.

## Agency

How individuals and institutions act under constraint. Where autonomy is real and where it is illusory.

*Coming soon.*

## Institutions

The rules, norms, and power structures that coordinate collective behaviour — and why they are so hard to change.

*Coming soon.*

## Work

What work is for, how it is organised, and what happens when automation reshapes the economy of effort.

*Coming soon.*

## Incentives

How reward structures shape behaviour at every scale — from individuals to markets to states.

*Coming soon.*
