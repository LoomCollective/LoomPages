Loom is a publication about computational thinking, environmental modelling, and the mathematics of complex systems.

Posts range from short notes to long-form computational essays with interactive visualisations — population dynamics, energy systems, ecological models — built to be read, not just cited.

## The setup

Posts are written in Markdown and published via Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Mathematical notation uses KaTeX. Diagrams use Mermaid. Interactive charts use Apache ECharts and D3. Maps use Leaflet. Scrollytelling stories use Scrollama.

The source for every post and the theme itself is public on GitHub.
