Loom Collective publishes essays on artificial intelligence, institutional change, and the structural forces shaping how we work and organise.

## What we write about

Four intersecting domains:

- **AI & institutional change** — how machine intelligence reshapes the rules, hierarchies, and power structures of organisations
- **Incentive structures** — why institutions behave as they do, and what it takes to change them
- **Power, governance, and work** — who holds authority, how it shifts, and what that means for people at every level
- **Systems thinking** — understanding complex adaptive systems, feedback loops, and emergent behaviour

## Why it matters

Most writing about AI focuses on the technology. We're more interested in the systems the technology is embedded in — the incentive structures, the power asymmetries, the institutional logics that shape what gets built and who it serves.

## About the author

Paul Hobson writes from the perspective of someone who has spent time building platforms, leading teams, and thinking carefully about how complex organisations actually function.
